        <p>The Aura Flight Bag is a backpack-style, custom-designed flight bag. It's currently in development by me, <a href="#about">Sophia Dengo</a>, a private pilot and member of the Ninety-Nines, who has yet to find her ideal flight bag. At the moment, this site serves as my submission for the <a href="https://www.dc99s.com/d4-awards" target="_blank">D4 Award</a>, sponsored by the DC 99s.</p>
        <p>You'll find sketches, thought processes, a preliminary PDF pattern, materials suggestions and instructions for creating your own version of the Aura. The site will remain online and evolving as I iterate on the bag.</p>
        <p>The first iteration was a paper prototype of the Aura, shown next to the Timbuk2 backpack I'm currently using as a flight bag.</p>

        <h2 class='margin-bottom-4'>Why design my own flight bag?</h2>
      </header>
      
      <p>There are countless well-designed, functional, rugged flight bags on the market, so why bother to design another one?</p>
      <p>So far, none of the bags I've tried out have hit the sweet spot of the features I need, and the aesthetic I want. Here's my personal checklist for what I want in this bag:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Backpack style:</b> because I find this the most comfortable to wear</li>
        <li><b>Some pockets -- but not too many:</b> There are some flight bags with infinite little pockets and zippered compartments, and I end up losing stuff in them. I need a couple of strategic, easily-accessed pockets for pens, my iPad, and my keys.</li>
        <li><b>Headset storage / protection:</b> not all headsets are created equal, but they all need to be protected while being carried.</li>
        <li><b>Easy interior bag access</b></li>
        <li><b>A safe place for snacks:</b> because all pilots need snacks, but crushed or melted snacks are no good.</li>
        <li><b>Structure and aesthetic:</b> The bag needs to have enough structure to protect its contents, but not so much as to be uncomfortable to wear. I'd also like my bag to fit my personal style better -- my favorite every day carry bags are soft leather or waxed canvas -- materials that age well, are relatively water-resistant, and don't have a utilitarian or militaristic edge to them.</li>
      </ul>

          <p class='margin-top-0'>My favorite thing about creating things for myself is that I get to make them as simple or as feature-packed as I'd like! The Aura bag tries to strike a balance: it has a few key features, but isn't super opinionated about how it "should" be worn otherwise.</p>

        <h2 class='margin-bottom-4'>The Fabric Prototype &amp; Materials Choices</h2>
      </header>
      
      <p>I've never designed a bag quite like this one. To work out whether I liked the size and how to construct the bag, I first built a paper prototype and then moved onto a fabric one. I also worked out what materials I want for my "final" bag.</p>

            src="./assets/images/prototype-closed.png"
            alt="Image of the fabric prototype all zipped up"
          />
          <p>With the bag closed, you can see how the zippers go all the way around the main compartment and the snackbag. From this I learned that the welt pocket on the front needs to be a little bit wider!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class='tablet:grid-col-6 padding-left-2'>

            src="./assets/images/fabric-prototype.png"
            alt="Image of the fabric prototype, unzipped"
          />
          <p>With the bag open, I was able to play with the modular pads (these are scavenged from a camera bag). I'll probably make a few extra pad sections to have on hand for other things that might live in my bag.</p>

        <div class='tablet:grid-col-7 padding-left-2'>
          <p>The materials for version 1 of the Aura are on order. I've chosen two shades of waxed canvas for the body of the bag, a cute floral waterproof fabric for the snackbag lining, and light-colored Veltex for the main lining. Plus coordinating thread and zippers, and some interesting woven webbing for the straps.</p>
