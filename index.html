        <p>The Aura Flight Bag is a backpack-style, custom-designed flight bag. It's currently in development by me, Sophia Dengo, a private pilot and member of the Ninety-Nines, who has yet to find her ideal flight bag. At the moment, this site serves as my submission for the <a href="https://www.dc99s.com/d4-awards" target="_blank">D4 Award</a>, sponsored by the DC 99s.</p>
        <p>You'll find sketches, thought processes, a preliminary PDF pattern, materials suggestions and instructions for creating your own version of the Aura. The site will remain online and evolving as I iterate on the bag.</p>
        <p>The first iteration was a paper prototype of the Aura, shown next to the Timbuk2 backpack I'm currently using as a flight bag.</p>

        <h2 class='margin-bottom-4'>Why design my own flight bag?</h2>
      </header>
      
      <p>There are countless well-designed, functional, rugged flight bags on the market, so why bother to design another one?</p>
      <p>So far, none of the bags I've tried out have hit the sweet spot of the features I need, and the aesthetic I want. Here's my personal checklist for what I want in this bag:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Backpack style:</b> because I find this the most comfortable to wear</li>
        <li><b>Some pockets -- but not too many:</b> There are some flight bags with infinite little pockets and zippered compartments, and I end up losing stuff in them. I need a couple of strategic, easily-accessed pockets for pens, my iPad, and my keys.</li>
        <li><b>Headset storage / protection:</b> not all headsets are created equal, but they all need to be protected while being carried.</li>
        <li><b>Easy interior bag access</b></li>
        <li><b>A safe place for snacks:</b> because all pilots need snacks, but crushed or melted snacks are no good.</li>
        <li><b>Structure and aesthetic:</b> The bag needs to have enough structure to protect its contents, but not so much as to be uncomfortable to wear. I'd also like my bag to fit my personal style better -- my favorite every day carry bags are soft leather or waxed canvas -- materials that age well, are relatively water-resistant, and don't have a utilitarian or militaristic edge to them.</li>
      </ul>

          <p class='margin-top-0'>My favorite thing about creating things for myself is that I get to make them as simple or as feature-packed as I'd like! The Aura bag tries to strike a balance: it has a few key features, but isn't super opinionated about how it "should" be worn otherwise.</p>

        <h2 class='margin-bottom-4'>The Fabric Prototype &amp; Materials Choices</h2>
      </header>
      
      <p>I've never designed a bag quite like this one. To work out whether I liked the size and how to construct the bag, I first built a paper prototype and then moved onto a fabric one. I also worked out what materials I want for my "final" bag.</p>

            alt="Image of the fabric prototype all zipped up"
          />
          <p>With the bag closed, you can see how the zippers go all the way around the main compartment and the snackbag. From this I learned that the welt pocket on the front needs to be a little bit wider!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class='tablet:grid-col-6 padding-left-2'>

            alt="Image of the fabric prototype, unzipped"
          />
          <p>With the bag open, I was able to play with the modular pads (these are scavenged from a camera bag). I'll probably make a few extra pad sections to have on hand for other things that might live in my bag.</p>

          <p>The materials for version 1 of the Aura are on order. I've chosen two shades of waxed canvas for the body of the bag, a cute floral waterproof fabric for the snackbag lining, and light-colored Veltex for the main lining. Plus coordinating thread and zippers, and some interesting woven webbing for the straps.</p>

        <h2>Bag Materials</h2>
      </header>
      
      <p>One of the reasons I don't have a fully finished version of this bag (yet!) is because I had to source materials, which has proven to be interesting in these pestilent, supply-restricted times. But my final bag will be made of the following:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Exterior Fabric</h3>
          <p>I've chosen waxed canvas for the exterior of the bag. It's a material I've worked with before, so I'm familiar with how to sew with it. The wax lends the fabric water-resistance, and it ages exceptionally well, taking on character and patina over time. It's also a heavier, stiffer fabric, which is important for a bag that needs some structure. Plus, it comes in a variety of colors!</p>
          
          <p>You need: x amount of material</p>
          <p>Get it at <a href="https://klumhouse.com/collections/fabric" target="_blank">Klum House</a></p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Snackbag Interior</h3>
          <p>For the snackbag, I want the interior to be truly waterproof and easily wipeable. Polyurethane laminate (PUL) is a popular choice for waterproof sewing, and because one of its primary applications is reusable diapers, PUL comes in a ton of patterns and colors. 
            
          <p>You need: x amount of material</p>
          <p>Get it on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/JulieAnneCrafts" target="_blank">Etsy</a></p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Snackbag Lining</h3>
          <p>The lining for the snackbag should offer some insulation -- ideally, I want to be able to stick an ice pack in there in the summer and expect it to remain reasonably cold! Insul-bright is an ideal choice, as it's made specifically to insulate against hot and cold. I need to experiment some here, but common wisdom indicates that using two layers of Insul-bright will provide the stiffness and structure I want for the base of the bag.</p>
            
          <p>You need: x amount of material</p>

        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Main Bag Interior</h3>
          <p>The choices for the interior of any main bag are pretty endless. Some standards among the bag-making community include natural duck canvas, cotton quilting fabric, upholstery-weight fabric, and vinyl. For my main bag, I want to be able to use hook-and-loop pads to create a headset compartment, so I need the fabric to be "sticky" to the hook side of the equation. I took to a camera bag for inspiration, and came away with Veltex Loop Fabric. It's a Velcro product that's often used on conference-booth backdrops, but it's soft enough to provide protection for my headset.</p>
          
          <p>You'll also use this material to create the modular interior pads.</p>

        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Main Bag Lining</h3>
          <p>The main bag, like the snackbag, needs some structure. It also needs a little bit of padding, both so that the bag is comfortable to wear, and also to protect your headset and other tech. There are a bunch of ways to achieve this; I'm choosing to use a stiff interfacing -- Pellon's Peltex stabilizer, ultra-firm.</p>

          <h3>Notions</h3>
          
          <ul>
            <li>1 yard 3/4" <a href="https://www.joann.com/search?q=3%2F4%22+velcro&lang=default" target="_blank">Velcro</a>. If you use iron-on Velcro, you might want to sew it on as well for extra durability!</li>
            <li>1" foam. I went with one package of <a href="https://www.joann.com/fairfield-2-pk-multi-purpose-project-foam/14649032.html" target="_blank">Fairfield Project Foam</a>, which should leave me plenty of extra for other projects!</li>

            <li>2 yards webbing or strapping for the backpack straps and carry handle</li>
            <li>4 adjustable slide buckles, wide enough to accomodate your straps</li>

            <li>Twill tape or ribbon for key lanyard, at least 8" long and 1/2" wide</li>
            <li>1 10" zipper (for the front welt pocket)</li>
            <li>2 36" double-ended zippers (I like <a href="https://www.wawak.com/Zippers/Jacket/Brass/ykk-5-brass-two-way-jacket-zipper/?sku=BZ5236MG" target="_blank">YKK brass zips</a>)</li>
