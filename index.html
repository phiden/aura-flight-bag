      </header>
      
      <p>There are countless flight bags on the market: well-designed, functional, rugged...so why bother to design another one? Because so far, none of the bags I've tried out have hit the sweet spot of the features I need, and the aesthetic I want. When I go flying, I want to focus on my mission, not on fiddling with a not-quite-right bag. And then when I'm done flying, I'd like my bag to be as well-suited to walking through town as it was to getting me there in the first place!</p>
      <p>I've been looking for three years for my perfect flight bag. To be fair, in the beginning, I had to define what the "perfect" bag even looked like to me! But I've come up with my personal, perfect-bag checklist, which I used in designing this bag:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Backpack style:</b> briefcase bags are uncomfortable to carry and entirely too masculine for my taste. Totes and cross-body bags start out ok, but I've found myself reaching for a backpack over and over.</li>
        <li><b>Some pockets -- but not too many:</b> There are some flight bags with infinite little pockets and zippered compartments, and I end up losing stuff in them. I need a couple of strategic, easily-accessed pockets for pens, my iPad, and my keys.</li>
        <li><b>Modular headset storage / protection:</b> not all headsets are created equal, but they all need to be protected while being carried. I'd like to be able to adjust my headset compartment to fit the set I'm using precisely, as opposed to using a separate carry bag or a compartment that's one-size-fits-most.</li>
        <li><b>Interior bag access:</b> I like to be able to open the front panel of a bag and see its entire contents -- more like a camera bag than a top-loading backpack.</li>
        <li><b>A safe place for snacks:</b> because all pilots need snacks, but crushed or melted snacks are no good.</li>
        <li><b>Structure and aesthetic:</b> a soft, floppy bag won't provide enough protection or structure for a flight bag, but a super rigid bag isn't comfortable to wear. I'm also not a fan of the black ballistic nylon or tan canvas that the most popular flight bags are made of (examples of "best flight bags:" <a href="https://www.thrustflight.com/the-best-flight-bags-for-pilots/" target="_blank">thrustflight.com</a>, <a href="https://studentpilotnews.com/2021/01/stay-organized-with-sportys-new-flight-gear-bags/" target="_blank">Sporty's,</a> and <a href="https://www.aviationconsumer.com/uncategorized/pilot-flight-bags-a-tote-for-every-purpose/" target="_blank">the Aviation Consumer</a>). My favorite every day carry bags are soft leather or waxed canvas -- materials that age well, are relatively water-resistant, and don't have a utilitarian or militaristic edge to them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are also things I didn't really design for with this bag, but that could be modified for: I'm not worried about waterproofing, being able to withstand much more than a drop off a low wing, and I don't think the straps need to survive several hundred pounds of tension. The beauty of making your own bag is that you can add or remove features to your heart's content!</p>

        <h2>Bag Materials</h2>
      </header>
      
      <p>One of the reasons I don't have a fully finished version of this bag (yet!) is because I had to source materials, which has proven to be interesting in these pestilent, supply-restricted times. But my final bag will be made of the following:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Exterior Fabric</h3>
          <p>I've chosen waxed canvas for the exterior of the bag. It's a material I've worked with before, so I'm familiar with how to sew with it. The wax lends the fabric water-resistance, and it ages exceptionally well, taking on character and patina over time. It's also a heavier, stiffer fabric, which is important for a bag that needs some structure. Plus, it comes in a variety of colors!</p>

        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Snackbag Interior</h3>
          <p>For the snackbag, I want the interior to be truly waterproof and easily wipeable. Polyurethane laminate (PUL) is a popular choice for waterproof sewing, and because one of its primary applications is reusable diapers, PUL comes in a ton of patterns and colors.

        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Snackbag Lining</h3>
          <p>The lining for the snackbag should offer some insulation -- ideally, I want to be able to stick an ice pack in there in the summer and expect it to remain reasonably cold! Insul-bright is an ideal choice, as it's made specifically to insulate against hot and cold. I need to experiment some here, but common wisdom indicates that using two layers of Insul-bright will provide the stiffness and structure I want for the base of the bag.</p>

          <h3>Main Bag Interior</h3>
          <p>The choices for the interior of any main bag are pretty endless. Some standards among the bag-making community include natural duck canvas, cotton quilting fabric, upholstery-weight fabric, and vinyl. For my main bag, I want to be able to use hook-and-loop pads to create a headset compartment, so I need the fabric to be "sticky" to the hook side of the equation. I took to a camera bag for inspiration, and came away with Veltex Loop Fabric. It's a Velcro product that's often used on conference-booth backdrops, but it's soft enough to provide protection for my headset.</p>
          
          <p>You'll also use this material to create the modular interior pads.</p>

          <h3>Main Bag Lining</h3>
          <p>The main bag, like the snackbag, needs some structure. It also needs a little bit of padding, both so that the bag is comfortable to wear, and also to protect your headset and other tech. There are a bunch of ways to achieve this; I'm choosing to use a stiff interfacing -- Pellon's Peltex stabilizer, ultra-firm.</p>
