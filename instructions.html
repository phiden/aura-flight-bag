      <p>This bag is constructed in sections and then assembled using a "zipper sandwich" method, along with some light hand-sewing to seal up the interior seams.</p>
      <p>When I built my paper and fabric prototypes, I was relying pretty heavily on previous bag-sewing experience. This section is the certain to evolve over time as I refine the bag's construction. I've included links here to various tutorials that I've used in the past, and referred to while building my prototypes.</p>

          <h3>Cut pattern pieces & prepare interfacing</h3>
          
          <p>Cut out all pattern pieces, making sure to transfer any markings and notches.</p>
          <p>Fuse interfacing to the <b>lining</b> pieces, not to the wax canvas because the wax will melt! For the snackbag, your interfacing should be sew-in; fusible won’t work if your lining is PUL as you could also melt that.</p>
          <p><b>Pro tip:</b> Don’t use pins or irons with waxed canvas or PUL. Instead of pins, use craft clips. Where the instructions indicate that you should press, use your fingers or a roller! </p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare Pockets</h3>
          <p>For both the exterior chart and Post-It pockets, and the interior tech pocket:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fold the top edge down ¼” and finger-press.</li>
            <li>Fold again another 1/4”, press, and topstitch in place.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For the Post-it and chart pockets:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Finish the bottom seam either with a zig-zag stitch or a serged edge.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For the welt pocket, we’ll take care of that when we prepare the front panel.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare Main Back Panel & Backpack Straps</h3>
          
          <p>You're going to make two adjustable backpack straps. Using one yard of your strapping for each one, follow this tutorial: <a href="https://www.sewalongs.com/cooper/cooper-how-to-create-adjustable-straps/" target="_blank">How to Create Adjustable Straps</a>.</p>
          
          <p>This tutorial teaches you to make adjustable straps, and the tab that will attach to the bottom of the backpack.</p>
          
          <p>To attach the straps at the top, mark two inches from the top of the back panel, and two inches in from each raw edge. These are your attach points.</p>
          
          <p>Cut a piece of webbing the width of your back panel (13" including the seam allowance). Pin one strap to each attach point at the top, right sides together, with the straps pointing up and away from the top of the bag. Baste in place at 1/2" seam allowance.</p>
          
          <p>Pin your 13" piece of webbing over the top of the strap attach points and topstitch in place along the top and the bottom. The edges will be caught when we attach the top and sides to the back.</p>
          
          <p>Attach your straps to the bottom of the bag along the side seam, about 1" from the bottom raw edge of the exterior. Use a 1/4" seam allowance.</p>
          
          <p>Pro tip: Before sewing in place, try your back piece on. If the straps placement feels uncomfortable, adjust them until they don't.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare Main Bag Top & Sides</h3>
          
          <p>This is where things get fun! Don't be afraid to use a ton of clips or pins as needed, or to really move the fabric to get it to lay as needed for sewing.</p>
          
          <h4>Attach Top Grab Handle</h4>
          
          <p>Cut a 10” piece of the same material your backpack straps are made of.
          <p>Finish each raw edge with a narrow zig-zag stitch, then match up each raw edge with the marking you transferred onto the top of the bag piece and pin.</p>
          <p>Using a straight stitch, attach the bag handle in a boxed-x pattern. The box should measure about an inch from the raw edge. Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NOc-h0P_e8</p>" target="_blank">great video tutorial</a> of how to best sew the X pattern.</p>
          
          <h4>Attach Pen Loops &amp; Post-it Pocket</h4>
          <p>You’ll be attaching the pockets to opposite sides of the main bag. The pattern has markings that indicate where the different pockets go, and where to begin and end the elastic.</p>
          <p>When attaching the elastic, I found it easiest to start at one edge, attach with a 1/4" seam allowance, and then sew at 1" intervals until I reach the right edge, where I secured it at the 1/4" seam allowance.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare Front Panel Exterior</h3>
          <p>The front panel has markings for a welt pocket. Rather than reinvent the instructional wheel, I’ll refer you to <a href="https://www.applegreencottage.com/how-to-sew-pocket/" target="_blank">this excellent tutorial for sewing welt pockets</a>.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare Front Panel Lining</h3>
          <p>Take the front panel lining piece and place it right side up on your work surface. Take the prepared tech pocket and place it, also right side up, on top of the front panel lining piece. Line up the bottom seams and edges, and pin (or clip!).</p>
          <p>Sew the sides and bottom of the tech pocket to the lining piece using a 1/4” seam allowance.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare Modular Pads</h3>
          <p>Measure your headset! You'll need to create at least two pads, but you can create as many as you like. My headset is roughly 11" by 7", and I'm using the bag depth of 6" as the last dimension.</p>
          <p>Cut two pieces of your Veltex for each pad. Dimensions should be your headset dimension on each axis, plus 2.5". So for me, I cut two sets of two pieces each: 
            <ul>
              <li>2 pieces: 13.5" by 8.5" (bag depth)</li>
              <li>2 pieces: 9.5" by 8.5"</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>Cut two pieces of the hook side of your Velcro for each pad, 6" each.</p>
          <p>Cut one piece of foam for each pad. I cut one at 11x6" and the other at 7x6". You can trim these as needed.</p>
          <p>For each set of pieces: right sides together, sew along the long sides and ONE 6" side, using a 1/2" seam allowance. Turn right side out and press.</p>
          <p>Along the 6" side you've sewn, measure in 1" from the sewn edge and mark. Attach your velcro as close to the seam as possible, sewing through both pieces of Veltex on all four sides of the Velcro. You should end up with a little Veltex pouch with a strip of Velcro along one end.</p>
          <p>Insert your foam into the little pouch, and secure by toptitching next to the foam at the open end of the pouch.</p>
          <p>Turn the raw edges of the Veltex in, press, and topstitch closed. Attach the Velcro on this end. Repeat for any other pads you'd like to make!</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare Snackbag</h3>
          <p>Attach interfacing to all pieces. Adhesive, double-stick tape, whatever you need to do -- I went for double-stick tape. The interfacing will be held in place permanently once you sew the bag together.</p>
          <p>The bottom of the bag pattern piece has two lines marked -- on your bottom, topstitch along these lines. This will help hold the interfacing in place and help you see where the bottom is, versus the front and back of the bag.</p>
          <p>Right sides together, attach the sides to the base piece using a 1/2” seam allowance. You may need to notch the corners to get a smooth join; just make sure you stay in the seam allowance so the cuts don't show in the finished bag!</p>
          <p>Repeat the same steps for the exterior of the snackbag: right sides together, attach the sides the main using a 1/2” seam allowance. </p>
          <p>Install the zipper using a "zipper sandwich" method. This is a place where using a ton of clips will help you keep the zipper from slipping around. Also, this is an excellent place to use your zipper foot!</p>
          <p>I referred to this tutorial for making my zip sandwich: <a href="https://elizabethmadethis.com/7-minute-diy-zipper-bag/" target="_blank">How to make a zipper bag</a>.</p>
          <p>At the end of this step, you should have a completed snack bag with an open top, ready for attaching the main bag.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare Main Bag</h3>
          <p>Attach interfacing to all pieces.</p>
          <p>Wrong sides together, attach the side/top piece to the back panel. Tuck the straps out of the way so you don’t sew over them, and sew using a 1/2” seam allowance. Leave the bottom seams open.</p>
          <p>Install zipper on the front panel – center the zipper with the top-center of the front panel and lining, and make another zipper sandwich with the front panel, zipper, and lining. Use a zipper foot and sew as close to the zipper as you can. Turn right side out, press, and topstitch the exterior front to the zipper.</p>
          <p>Repeat with the top/sides exterior and lining, and the other side of the zipper. Leave the bottom seams open.</p>
          <p>Here, I'll refer you to two great videos about attaching lined top bags to lined bottom bags, because it's time to attach the main bag to the snack bag! I found these both instructive and better than every draft I've written of this part of the process.</p>
