      <p>This bag is constructed in sections and then assembled using a "zipper sandwich" method, along with some light hand-sewing to seal up the interior seams.</p>

          <h3>Exterior Fabric</h3>
          <p>I've chosen waxed canvas for the exterior of the bag. It's a material I've worked with before, so I'm familiar with how to sew with it. The wax lends the fabric water-resistance, and it ages exceptionally well, taking on character and patina over time. It's also a heavier, stiffer fabric, which is important for a bag that needs some structure. Plus, it comes in a variety of colors!</p>

          <h3>Snackbag Interior</h3>
          <p>For the snackbag, I want the interior to be truly waterproof and easily wipeable. Polyurethane laminate (PUL) is a popular choice for waterproof sewing, and because one of its primary applications is reusable diapers, PUL comes in a ton of patterns and colors.

        <li>
          <h3>Snackbag Lining</h3>
          <p>The lining for the snackbag should offer some insulation -- ideally, I want to be able to stick an ice pack in there in the summer and expect it to remain reasonably cold! Insul-bright is an ideal choice, as it's made specifically to insulate against hot and cold. I need to experiment some here, but common wisdom indicates that using two layers of Insul-bright will provide the stiffness and structure I want for the base of the bag.</p>

          <h3>Main Bag Interior</h3>
          <p>The choices for the interior of any main bag are pretty endless. Some standards among the bag-making community include natural duck canvas, cotton quilting fabric, upholstery-weight fabric, and vinyl. For my main bag, I want to be able to use hook-and-loop pads to create a headset compartment, so I need the fabric to be "sticky" to the hook side of the equation. I took to a camera bag for inspiration, and came away with Veltex Loop Fabric. It's a Velcro product that's often used on conference-booth backdrops, but it's soft enough to provide protection for my headset.</p>
          
          <p>You'll also use this material to create the modular interior pads.</p>

          <h3>Main Bag Lining</h3>
          <p>The main bag, like the snackbag, needs some structure. It also needs a little bit of padding, both so that the bag is comfortable to wear, and also to protect your headset and other tech. There are a bunch of ways to achieve this; I'm choosing to use a stiff interfacing -- Pellon's Peltex stabilizer, ultra-firm.</p>
